== Getting latest source code and Python for S60 ==

 # Download the latest source code. You will see a zip file following the pattern "wordmobi-version-src.zip" in [http://code.google.com/p/wordmobi/downloads/list download tab]. Use the more recent one. If you are in doubt, please drop me an email (marcelobarrosalmeida at gmail.com).
 # Inside this zip file you will see several .py file under a src directory. Just copy all python file into e:\python\lib, in our phone memory card. Create this path if it not exists.
 # Move file default.py to e:\python. 
 # Check if you have [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155&package_id=171153&release_id=644640 PythonForS60 1.4.5] installed and [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155&package_id=171153&release_id=644640 PythonScriptShell 1.4.5] installed. If not, download and install them from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155&package_id=171153&release_id=644640 Sourceforge].

== Creating our locale file ==

You will need to choose one language for starting from. At this moment, only English and Brazilian Portuguese are available. In source files (e:\python\lib), these two translation are available as:

 * wmlocale_en_us.py (English)
 * wmlocale_pt_br.py (Brazilian Portuguese)

These file names follow the nomenclature wmlocale_<[http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1 ISO 639-1 code]>_<[http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1 ISO 3166-1 code]>. ISO 639-1 is a two letter code for representing language names and ISO 3166-1 is another two letter code for country name. Country name may be omitted if the language does not have any variation. 

Using this pattern, copy one translation available and rename it according to your language\country (if any).

Copy the desired language and save following the patter wmlocale_
