= Installing wordmobi =

<font color="blue">*Wordmobi and Python runtime must be installed in the same location*</font>, phone memory or memory card. Python runtime does not support applications in different locations.

First install [http://wordmobi.googlecode.com/files/Python_1.9.6.sis Python 1.9.6 runtime] and after [http://wordmobi.googlecode.com/files/Wordmobi-0.9.0.sis Wordmobi 0.9.0]. I tested the current version in S60 3rd and 5th edition phones (E71 and XM 5800)

There are requirements for Wordpress as well. Comments will work only with Wordpress [http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-xmlrpc/2008-October/000277.html 2.6.2] or newer. 

Wordmobi saves all relevant data in the drive you have chosen, under directory {drive}:\data\python\wordmobidir. The following directories are used:

 * {drive}:\data\python\wordmobidir => wordmobi python files and configuration files
 * {drive}:\data\python\wordmobidir\cache => temporary downloads and temporary htmls files used during preview. Its contents is cleared when wordmobi is closed.
 * {drive}:\data\python\wordmobidir\images => snapshots taken
 * {drive}:\data\python\wordmobidir\loc => locales
 * {drive}:\data\python\wordmobidir\res => resource images

= Setup =

Before using wordmobi, please setup your blog account, user details, proxy (if any) and access point. Proxy is supported, even if using  authentication. If your access point is not listed, please, save it to your connections before starting wordmobi.

Wordmobi was designed to support any domain running wordpress with compatible XMLRPC API. <font color="blue">*Just set your blog address*</font> (for instance, http://www.mydomain.com or http://myblog.wordpress.com). If you have your blog running inside some subdirectory, like /my/blog, use http://www.mydomain.com/my/blog. <font color="blue">*Do not put any trailing slash and do not put xmlrpc.php at the end*</font> (they are automatically removed and just added when accessing your blog). 

However, if your blog has a customized URL for XMLRPC API (not ending with xmlrpc.php), this URL will not be replaced. Just fill the blog address with you customized URL, including the php file name.

If you want to use blog view statistics, pay attention in the following points:
 * For people running blogs in wordpress.com, just take note of your [http://faq.wordpress.com/2005/10/19/api-key/ API key] and setup your account with it. 
 * For blogs not hosted by wordpress, please read [http://en.wordpress.com/features/stats/ this page] for tips about configuring the required plugin. Feedback is welcome since I do not have blogs outside wordpress.

If you are not receiving the blog view statistics, please do the following:
 * Put the following URL in your browser <font color="blue">*http://stats.wordpress.com/csv.php?api_key={your_api}&blog_uri={your_blog_uri}&blog_id=0&days=365&limit=-1*</font>  replacing {your_api} for you API key (remove brackets for both fields) and {your_blog_uri} for your blog URL (the same string you put at account setup dialog, like http://yourblog.wordpress.com). 
 * Check if you are receiving a valid response with statistics or just a help page. 

<font color="blue">*Usernames are case sensitive for wordpress*</font>, so take care when typing your username. Check if all fields does not have any trailer space.

Also <font color="blue">*enable installation of any application in your mobile phone, not only the certificated ones*</font>. In Settings->Applications->App. Manager allow all applications and disable certification checks.

<font color="blue">*It is necessary to activate xmlrpc support in wordpress for people running blogs in their own domains*</font>. Check 

http://blogname/wp-admin/options-writing.php

for enabling it.
