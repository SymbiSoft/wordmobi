#summary Wordmobi installation

= Installing wordmobi =

First install Python for your S60 mobile phone. The latest version is [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=154155 1.4.5]. 

There requirements for Wordpress as well. Comments will work only with wordpress [http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-xmlrpc/2008-October/000277.html 2.6.2] or newer. 

I tested the current version only in S60 3rd edition phones (N95 and E71), using Python   [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pys60/PythonForS60_1_4_4_3rdEd.sis?modtime=1214578033&big_mirror=0 PythonForS60 1.4.4] and [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pys60/PythonForS60_1_4_5_3rdEd.sis?modtime=1228327213&big_mirror=0 PythonForS60 1.4.5].

Wordmobi saves all relevant data in memory card. So, do not forget to insert one (drive e:\ is required). The directories used are the following:

 * e:\wordmobi => settings database
 * e:\wordmobi\cache => temporary downloads and temporary htmls files used during preview. Its contents is cleared when wordmobi is closed.
 * e:\wordmobi\images => snapshots taken

= Setup =

Before using wordmobi, please setup your blog account, user details, proxy (if any) and access point. It is important to fill up all fields, like your email and full name. They will be used when you add a new comment. Proxy is supported, even if using  authentication. If your access point is not listed, please, save it to your connections before starting wordmobi.

Wordmobi was designed to support any domain running wordpress with compatible xmlrpc API. In fact, the only think Wormobi needs is the file xmlrpc.php. It uses the url you set (for instance, http://www.mydomain.com) and add 'xmlrpc.php' to it, so http://www.mydomain.com/xmlrpc.php is the key for the access. Or, if you have your blog running inside some subdirectory, like /my/blog, use http://www.mydomain.com/my/blog. Do not put any trailing slash as well.

Usernames are case sensitive for wordpress, so take care when typing your username. Check if all fields does not have any trailer space.


I read somewhere that there is an option in wordpress for activating xmlrpc. Check 

http://blogname/wp-admin/options-writing.php

 for enabling it.
 I couldnÂ´t see any, however, in my wordpress version.
