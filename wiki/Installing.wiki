= Installing wordmobi =

*Wordmobi and Python must be installed in memory phone*. This is the only use case tested and users are reporting problems when Python is not installed on memory phone. 

First install Python for your S60 mobile phone and appropriated Wordmobi version. I tested the current version only in S60 3rd edition phones (N95 and E71), using [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pys60/PythonForS60_1_4_5_3rdEd.sis PythonForS60 1.4.5] and [https://garage.maemo.org/frs/download.php/5325/Python_1.9.2_3rdEd.sis PythonForS60 1.9.2]. If you running a feature pack 2 device, like Nokia XM 5800, install [https://garage.maemo.org/frs/download.php/5326/Python_1.9.2_3rdEdFP2.sis PythonForS60 FP2 1.9.2]

After, install Wordmobi for Python [http://wordmobi.googlecode.com/files/Wordmobi-0.6.0.sis 1.4.5] or for [http://wordmobi.googlecode.com/files/Wordmobi-0.6.0-py19.sis 1.9.2].

There requirements for Wordpress as well. Comments will work only with wordpress [http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-xmlrpc/2008-October/000277.html 2.6.2] or newer. 

Wordmobi saves all relevant data in memory card. So, do not forget to insert one (drive e:\ is required). The directories used are the following:

 * e:\wordmobi => settings database
 * e:\wordmobi\cache => temporary downloads and temporary htmls files used during preview. Its contents is cleared when wordmobi is closed.
 * e:\wordmobi\images => snapshots taken

= Setup =

Before using wordmobi, please setup your blog account, user details, proxy (if any) and access point. It is important to fill up all fields, like your email and full name. They will be used when you add a new comment. Proxy is supported, even if using  authentication. If your access point is not listed, please, save it to your connections before starting wordmobi.

Wordmobi was designed to support any domain running wordpress with compatible xmlrpc API. In fact, the only think Wormobi needs is the file xmlrpc.php. It uses the url you set (for instance, http://www.mydomain.com) and add 'xmlrpc.php' to it, so http://www.mydomain.com/xmlrpc.php is the key for the access. Or, if you have your blog running inside some subdirectory, like /my/blog, use http://www.mydomain.com/my/blog. Do not put any trailing slash as well.

Usernames are case sensitive for wordpress, so take care when typing your username. Check if all fields does not have any trailer space.

Also enable installation of any application in your mobile phone, not only the certificated ones. In Settings->Applications->App. Manager allow all applications and disable certification checks.

I read somewhere that there is an option in wordpress for activating xmlrpc. Check 

http://blogname/wp-admin/options-writing.php

for enabling it.

I couldnÂ´t see any, however, in my wordpress version. See [http://coolwebdeveloper.com/2008/12/writing-your-wordpress-blog-articles-remotely-using-xml-rpc-using-windows-live-writer-with-your-wordpress-blog/ this link] and [http://www.wpnotifier.com/enable_xmlrpc.php this]
