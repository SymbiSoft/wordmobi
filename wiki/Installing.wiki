= Installing wordmobi =

<font color="blue">*Wordmobi and Python must be installed in memory phone*</font>. This is the only use case tested and users arere reporting problems when Python is not installed on memory phone. 

First install Python for your S60 mobile phone. I tested the current version with S60 3rd and 5th edition phones (E71 and XM 5800), using [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pys60/PythonForS60_1_4_5_3rdEd.sis PythonForS60 1.4.5] and [http://wordmobi.googlecode.com/files/Python_1.9.5.sis PythonForS60 1.9.5]. 

After, install [http://wordmobi.googlecode.com/files/Wordmobi-0.8.1.sis Wordmobi 0.8.1 for Python 1.4.5] or [http://wordmobi.googlecode.com/files/Wordmobi-0.8.1-py19.sis Wordmobi 0.8.1 for Python 1.9.5].

There are requirements for Wordpress as well. Comments will work only with Wordpress [http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-xmlrpc/2008-October/000277.html 2.6.2] or newer. 

<font color="blue">Wordmobi saves all relevant data in memory card. So, do not forget to insert one (drive e:\ is required)</font>. The following directories are used:

 * e:\wordmobi => settings database
 * e:\wordmobi\cache => temporary downloads and temporary htmls files used during preview. Its contents is cleared when wordmobi is closed.
 * e:\wordmobi\images => snapshots taken

= Setup =

Before using wordmobi, please setup your blog account, user details, proxy (if any) and access point. Proxy is supported, even if using  authentication. If your access point is not listed, please, save it to your connections before starting wordmobi.

Wordmobi was designed to support any domain running wordpress with compatible XMLRPC API. <font color="blue">*Just set your blog address*</font> (for instance, http://www.mydomain.com or http://myblog.wordpress.com). If you have your blog running inside some subdirectory, like /my/blog, use http://www.mydomain.com/my/blog. <font color="blue">*Do not put any trailing slash and do not put xmlrpc.php at the end*</font> (they are automatically removed and just added when accessing your blog). 

However, if your blog has a customized URL for XMLRPC API (not ending with xmlrpc.php), this URL will not be replaced. Just fill the blog address with you customized URL, including the php file name.

<font color="blue">*Usernames are case sensitive for wordpress*</font>, so take care when typing your username. Check if all fields does not have any trailer space.

Also <font color="blue">*enable installation of any application in your mobile phone, not only the certificated ones*</font>. In Settings->Applications->App. Manager allow all applications and disable certification checks.

<font color="blue">*It is necessary to activate xmlrpc support in wordpress for people running blogs in their own domains*</font>. Check 

http://blogname/wp-admin/options-writing.php

for enabling it.
