=== 1) Wordmobi is not running, unexpectedly closing or got stuck in some point ===

The best thing to do in such situation is running the scripts. Download the source code for your version e run wormobi from scripts. The download may be done [http://code.google.com/p/wordmobi/source/checkout using subversion] or file by file, using the [http://code.google.com/p/wordmobi/source/browse/#svn/trunk/wordmobi/src source code browser]. 

Afterward, do the following:

 # Install python and python shell, version 1.4.5
 # In our memory card, create directories e:\python and e:\python\lib
 # Remove or comment the line at the end of wordmobi.py with the folowwing text: "app.set_exit()". For commenting, just put # at the beginning, like #app.set_exit().
 # Copy all files into e:\python\lib, except wordmobi.py
 # Copy wordmobi.py into e:\python\
 # Run wordmoby.py via python shell, opening Python and selecting "Option->Run script"

This way, it will be possible to see the error messages or to add logs and alerts during execution. Please, collect these log messages and send to developers.
