The contents edit window is similar to the html edit dialog found at Wordpress, with same html commands. Only newlines are automatically translated to <br> tags. The others tags need to be inserted using menu shortcuts.

You may insert images from local files, URLs or you may take a shot and add it to your post, while editing. Images are uploaded to wordpress gallery and linked to your post.

If you want, there is a html preview as well in contents edit window. In fact, wordmobi call the default browser for presenting your current post.

You have a similar view when creating a new post (posts->new). If you want to post but not to publish the post, set field "Publish" to "No (draft)". You may publish it later, if you want, just editing it and setting "Publish" to "Yes".

In the post list, pressing select it is possible to download all comments for some post. The comment view is intuitive and you may approve, reply, delete and edit comments. Comments are organized in a per post basis, slightly different from original wordpress site, where comments are presented together. Again, comments are download only when necessary, saving bandwidth.
