#summary Desired features and enhancements

= Current implemented features and caveats =

 * Show a fixed number of recent posts
 * Allow new posts with text and images. I have verified that images are not so stable and a retransmission mechanism should be implemented.
 * Post deletion
 * Post visualization working but need improvements.

= Future enhancements =

 * Comments visualization and moderation
 * Local posts persistence
 * Categories management
 * Post status, allowing to post but not publish and to approve for publishing when desired  
 * Icons in all list views
 * Image visualization when selecting images
 * better icon for wordmobi
 * TAGs support
 * Better post edition dialog, supporting:
 ** Insert->Links
 ** User friendly edition instead HTML
 ** Newlines preservation (instead explicit {{{<br>}}})
